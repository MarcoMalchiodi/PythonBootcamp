/*
Sass allows nesting of CSS rules, which is a useful way of organizing a style sheet.

Normally, each element is targeted on a different line to style it, like so:
*/
article {
  height: 200px;
}

article p {
  color: white;
}

article ul {
  color: blue;
}



// For a large project, the CSS file will have many lines and rules. This is where nesting can 
// help organize your code by placing child style rules within the respective parent elements:

article {
  height: 200px;

  p {
    color: white;
  }

  ul {
    color: blue;
  }
}
